## Introduction

This is a simulation of a ticketing system, which calculates a fare based on
how long a car or other vehicle has been parked, and how much was actually
purchased, and prints a ticket.

## Building and Running

> [!warning]
> On Windows, it's highly recommended you use MSYS2, as this will allow you
> to use `make` and access a *nix environment which the simulator was built
> in mind for.

This project uses a Makefile.

To compile the project, run `make`. A binary will be created in the `bin`
directory. If you prefer to run straight away, run `make buildrun`.

## Usage

When running the program, you'll be asked to input your name and badge number.

```plain
$ ./bin/ticket_parking_simulator
Enter your name: John
Enter your badge number: 1234ABC
```

You'll then be shown the welcome message and be asked to enter car information.

```plain
Welcome to Parking Ticket Simulator

Welcome officer John
The system is ready to use.

```

```plain
Please enter car information, separated by spaces.

Toyota Celery Grellow 12421323
Car Make: Toyota
Car Model: Celery
Car Colour: Grellow
Licence Number: 12421323
```

The program will then ask how many minutes of parking the driver purchased, and
how long the car has actually been parked.

```plain
How many minutes of parking were purchased?
20
How many minutes has the vehicle been parked?
50
```

Finally, the program will "print" out a ticket with car information and the
base, additional and total fine.

```plain
------------------------------

    Car Make: Toyota
    Car Model: Celery

```

The program will then exit.
